### Technical Document: E10 Floor Lamp (T8L40) Animation Protocol Research

#### Objective
Enable high-fidelity, JSON-based animations (e.g., Fireworks) for the Eufy E10 Floor Lamp (model T8L40) within the `eufylife_api` HACS integration.

---

#### 1. The Rosetta Stone: T8L40 Protocol Map

| Component | V0 (Standard Control) | V1 (Reports / Modern) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Byte 5 (Version)** | `00` | `01` |
| **Envelope** | **Required** (A1: Time, A2: User) | Usually None (Raw Tags) |
| **Primary Opcode** | `0201`, `0202`, `0206` | `0204`, `1000` |
| **A1 Label** | Timestamp (4b) or Power (1b) | Power (1b) |
| **A2 Label** | User ID (40b) or Brightness (1b) | Brightness (1b) |
| **A3 Label** | Payload (4b) or Segments (1b) | Segments (**2b** in reports) |
| **A4 Label** | N/A (in V0 reqs) | Internal ID (**2b** in reports) |
| **A7 Label** | N/A | Mode (1b for Effect, 16b Static) |
| **AB Label** | Animation JSON (V0-AB) | Animation JSON (V1-AB) |

---

#### 2. Discovered Opcodes (Commands)

| Opcode | Name | Type | Key Discovery |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`0200`** | Session Handshake | V0 | Required to initialize session / unlock communications. |
| **`0201`** | Set Power | V0 | Basic ON/OFF toggle. |
| **`0202`** | Set Scene | V0 | Cloud scene shortcut; silent ACK on T8L40 but does not render animations. |
| **`0204`** | State Report | V1 | Unsolicited state report broadcast by lamp when effects/power change. |
| **`0206`** | Set Effect | V0 | Classic dynamic effects & static segment DIY colors (e.g. 20006). |
| **`020D`** | **Set Animation** | **V0** | **The Authentic App Method.** Binary-encoded multi-layer animation structs. |
| **`0A0D`** | Animation ACK | V0 | Immediate status `00` acknowledgment for `020D`. |
| **`1000`** | Heartbeat | V1 | Periodic status report verifying device connectivity. |

#### 3. Label (Tag) Deep Dive for T8L40

- **`A1` (4 bytes)**: Unix Timestamp (Little Endian). Part of the command envelope.
- **`A1` (1 byte)**: Power Status in raw frames.
- **`A2` (40 bytes)**: User ID Hex String. Part of the command envelope.
- **`A2` (1 byte)**: Brightness percentage (0-100).
- **`A3` (4 bytes)**: Scene ID or Session Mask.
- **`A3` (2 bytes)**: Lamp Count (`0c 00`) in reports.
- **`A4` (2 bytes)**: Internal Effect ID (e.g., `66 2a` for Fireworks).
- **`A6` (4 bytes)**: Official Cloud ID.
- **`A7` (1 byte)**: Mode. `02` for animations, `10 00...` for static.
- **`A9` (12 bytes)**: Auxiliary IDs block.
- **`AB` (Long TLV)**: The multi-layer JSON defining the animation.

---

#### 4. The "Silent State" Mismatch
We have successfully reached a state where the lamp's heartbeat reports it is in Fireworks mode (`A4: 10854, A7: 02`), yet the physical light remains on the previous static color (Red). This confirms that the **Rendering Engine** requires a specific trigger that is independent of the **State Register**.

#### 5. Verification History (Key Batches)
- **Batch 27**: Set Red via `0206 + V0 + Envelope`. **Full Success.**
- **Batch 32**: Set Fireworks State via `0204 + V1 + No Envelope`. **Silent Success** (Internal state only).
- **Batch 35**: Set Fireworks via `0206 + V0 + Envelope`. **Failed.** (JSON too large for V0 buffer?).
- **Batch 36**: Set Fireworks via `0202 + V0 + Envelope`. **Silent Success** (Status 00 but state reverted).
- **Interactive menu regression**: Selecting preset `26` with blank speed and direction
  took the `scene_id=10095` shortcut in `async_set_effect`. The lamp acknowledged
  `0202`, but the existing render continued; this is not proof that the animation ran.
- **App capture**: The visible-animation command was `0206`, frame version `01`,
  with `A3=0c`, `A4=10854` as a 2-byte internal ID, `A6=10854` as a 4-byte cloud
  ID, `A7=02`, long `AB` JSON, and trailing `A8`, `A9` (12 bytes), `AE`, and `B0`.

#### 6. Current Corrected Activation Path
For built-in T8L40 entries that contain `params`, option `4` must use the
captured `0206/v1` effect command even when speed and direction are left blank.
The `0202` scene shortcut remains useful as an advanced diagnostic, but its
acknowledgement only confirms command acceptance, not physical rendering.

---

#### 7. Final Summary of Findings
- **V0 vs V1 Partition**: Simple commands (Power/Scene/Handshake) use Version 0 with an Envelope. Modern renders (Animations) use Version 1 without an Envelope.
- **Handshake Unlock**: The T8L40 requires a Session Handshake (`0200`) before it will physically trigger any Version 1 rendering commands.
- **Tag Precision**: For the captured effect request, `A3` is the one-byte lamp
  count, `A4` is the two-byte internal effect ID, and `A6` is the four-byte cloud ID.

#### 8. Final Implementation Sequence
1.  **Handshake**: `0200` + V0 + Envelope + Mask `ff010000`.
2.  **Activate/render**: `0206` + V1 + Envelope + `A3/A4/A6/A7/AB/A8/A9/AE/B0`.
3.  **Verify**: Check the physical lamp; a status `00` or heartbeat ID alone is
    insufficient because the silent-state failure is possible.

#### 9. Latest Real-Device Validation (2026-09-16)
- Baseline was collected from serial `T8L4081024334CBC`: the lamp was `ON` at
  `30%`, with `A4=1f00` and `A7=00`; it was not reporting Fireworks mode.
- The named command path was run with `scripts/set_env.sh` and
  `--animation "Guy Fawkes Night"`; the catalog contained the expected preset.
- The command performed the `0200` handshake successfully and emitted the
  captured `0206`/version-1 animation request.
- No `opcode=(10, 6)` acknowledgement was received. The client timed out in
  `async_set_effect` and raised `Light did not acknowledge the color/preset`.
- A successful handshake and transmitted `0206` frame therefore remain
  insufficient evidence; the post-command internal state and visual output
  must both be checked. This run did not confirm Fireworks rendering.
- Visual confirmation after the run: no change; the lamp continued its
  existing rainbow animation rather than switching to Guy Fawkes Night.

#### 10. Protocol Version & Scenario Comparison Matrix (2026-09-16)

| Scenario / Goal | Protocol Version & Opcode | Framing & Payload Details | Observed Lamp Behavior | Status / Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **JSON Animation Payload** | **V1 (`01`)**<br>`0206` (Set Effect) | Frame byte 5 = `01`. `_t8l40_animation_payload` with envelope tags `A1/A2/A3/A4/A6/A7`, long `AB` JSON, and trailing `A8/A9/AE/B0`. Handshake `0200` sent beforehand. | **Timeout**. Lamp never returned `(10, 6)` acknowledgement. Physical render remained unchanged. | **FAILED** (Device firmware does not parse raw JSON over `0206`). |
| **Cloud Scene ID Trigger** | **V0 (`00`)**<br>`0202` (Set Scene) | Frame byte 5 = `00`. Envelope (`A1` timestamp, `A2` user ID) + tag `A3` 4-byte scene ID (e.g., `10095`). | **Silent ACK**. Lamp returned status `00`, but physical rendering engine did not adopt or switch animation. | **FAILED** (State accepted, but rendering did not change). |
| **Classic Dynamic Effect Trigger** | **V0 (`00`)**<br>`0206` (Set Effect) | Frame byte 5 = `00`. Envelope (`A1` timestamp, `A2` user ID) + `_effect_payload`: tag `A3` dynamic ID (e.g. `20006`), tag `A6` palette bytes, tag `A7` lamp indices, tag `A8` speed, tag `A9` direction, tag `AC` cloud ID. | **Static / Non-Rendering ACK**. Lamp responded with status `00` on opcode `(10, 6)` and state showed `20006`, but `20006` is static DIY segment color mode. Physical animation did not play. | **FAILED** (Only sets static segment colors; does not trigger animation engine). |
| **Binary Layer Animation Trigger** | **V0 (`00`)**<br>`020D` (Set Animation) | Frame byte 5 = `00`. Envelope (`A1` timestamp, `A2` user ID) + tag `A3` effect ID (4B LE), tag `A4` speed (1B), tag `A5` layer count (1B), tag `A6` execution mode (1B), tag `A8` (1B 0x00), tags `A9`, `AA` binary-packed layer structs. | **Full Success**. Lamp immediately acknowledges with status `00` on opcode `(10, 13)` (`0A0D`), emits state report `(2, 4)` (`0204`), and immediately renders the physical multi-layer animation on the LEDs. Validated bidirectionally between *Guy Fawkes Night* and *Celebrating*. | **VERIFIED WORKING** (Official Eufy Life App protocol). |

#### 11. Complete Deep-Dive: The Authentic `020D` Animation Engine

##### Discovery Methodology
A live MQTT packet sniffer was deployed against the active AWS IoT MQTT broker, subscribing to `cmd/eufy_life/#` and `synq/eufy_life/#`. The user activated built-in animations (*Guy Fawkes Night* ID `10854`, *Celebrating* ID `10599`, *Party* ID `10589`) from the official Eufy Life mobile application on lamp `T8L4081024334CBC`.

##### Command Frame Anatomy
- **Command Opcode**: `(0x02, 0x0D)` (`020D`)
- **Response Opcode**: `(0x0A, 0x0D)` (`0A0D`), payload: `00 a1 01 00` (Status `00`)
- **Protocol Version**: Version 0 (`0x00`), with standard envelope:
  * `Tag 0xA1` (4 bytes, uint32 LE): Current Unix timestamp
  * `Tag 0xA2` (40 bytes, ASCII): 40-character User ID hex string
- **Animation Body Tags**:
  * `Tag 0xA3` (4 bytes, uint32 LE): Cloud Light/Effect ID (`10854` = `66 2a 00 00`, `10599` = `67 29 00 00`)
  * `Tag 0xA4` (1 byte, uint8): Effect speed (from JSON `light_effect_speed`, e.g. `54` = `0x36`)
  * `Tag 0xA5` (1 byte, uint8): Number of layers (from JSON `len(layer)`, e.g. `2` = `0x02`)
  * `Tag 0xA6` (1 byte, uint8): Layer execution mode (from JSON `layer_execution_mode`, e.g. `3` or `0`)
  * `Tag 0xA8` (1 byte, uint8): Mode flag (`0x00`)
  * `Tag 0xA9`: Layer 0 packed binary data
  * `Tag 0xAA`: Layer 1 packed binary data (if layer count $\ge 2$)
  * `Tag 0xAB`: Layer 2 packed binary data (if layer count $\ge 3$)

##### Layer Binary Struct Specification
The Eufy application compiles the catalog JSON animation layers into packed C structs before transmission. Each layer comprises a 10-byte common header, a variable-length palette block, and type-specific execution parameters:

1. **Common Header (10 bytes)**:
   * Offset `0x00` (1B): `layer_priority` (uint8)
   * Offset `0x01` (1B): `layer_speed` (uint8)
   * Offset `0x02` (1B): `layer_range[1]` (uint8, upper segment limit, e.g. `100` = `0x64`)
   * Offset `0x03` (1B): `layer_range[0]` (uint8, lower segment limit, e.g. `0` = `0x00` or `75` = `0x4B`)
   * Offset `0x04` (1B): `interval_type` (uint8, default `1`)
   * Offset `0x05` (1B): `interval_value` (uint8, default `1`)
   * Offset `0x06-0x07` (2B, Big Endian uint16): `layer_execution_parameter` (e.g. `130` = `0x0082`, `128` = `0x0080`)
   * Offset `0x08` (1B): `light_effect_post_cycle_status` (uint8)
   * Offset `0x09` (1B): `current_layer_type` (`0` = Flow/Insert, `1` = Cycle/Gradient, `2` = Twinkle/Blink)

2. **Colors Block ($1 + 5N$ bytes)**:
   * Offset `0x0A` (1B): Color count $N$ (e.g. `5` = `0x05`)
   * Followed by $N$ 5-byte color entries: Eufy 5-channel PWM drive levels `[R, G, B, W, C]` calibrated for the T8L40 LED strip hardware.

3. **Type-Specific Parameters**:
   * **Type 0 (`current_layer_type == 0`, 17 trailing bytes)**:
     `color_fill_mode` (1B), `color_pick_mode` (1B), `flow_direction` (1B), `direction_change_mode` (1B), `insert_block_mode` (1B), `insert_block_range` (2B BE uint16), `insert_black_block_mode` (1B), `insert_black_block_range` (2B BE uint16), `insert_position_mode` (1B), `brightness_variation_type` (1B), `brightness_range[1]` (1B), `brightness_range[0]` (1B), `light_effect_cycle_method` (1B), `execution_parameter` (1B).
   * **Type 1 (`current_layer_type == 1`, 10 trailing bytes)**:
     `brightness_value` (1B), `display_mode` (1B), `color_quantity_range` (1B), `transition_mode` (1B), `color_switch_mode` (1B), `color_pick_sequence` (1B), `reserved` (2B: `00 00`), `light_effect_cycle_method` (1B), `execution_parameter` (1B).
   * **Type 2 (`current_layer_type == 2`, 12 trailing bytes)**:
     `brightness_variation_type` (1B), `brightness_range[1]` (1B), `brightness_range[0]` (1B), `blink_cycle_count` (1B), `blink_position_mode` (1B), `blink_interval[1]` (1B), `blink_interval[0]` (1B), `blink_quantity` (1B), `blink_asynchrony` (1B), `blink_color_switch_mode` (1B), `light_effect_cycle_method` (1B), `execution_parameter` (1B).

##### Lamp State Broadcast (`0204`)
Upon receiving and starting a `020D` animation, the physical lamp emits an unsolicited state broadcast on opcode `(0x02, 0x04)` (Version 1, len=51):
* `Tag 0xA1` (1B): Power status (`01` = ON)
* `Tag 0xA2` (1B): Brightness (`1E` = 30%)
* `Tag 0xA3` (1B): Segment count (`0C` = 12)
* `Tag 0xA4` (4B LE uint32): Active effect ID (e.g. `10854` = `66 2a 00 00`)
* `Tag 0xA5` (1B): Sub-status (`00`)
* `Tag 0xA6` (4B LE uint32): Cloud preset ID (`10854`)
* `Tag 0xA7` (1B): Operational Mode (`02` = Dynamic Animation Mode)
* `Tag 0xA9` (12B): Auxiliary state transition record

#### 12. Cross-Check Against the Independent `eufy-sdk` Project (2026-09-29)

`mega-yfue/eufy-sdk` is an unrelated TypeScript client for the same Anker cloud. It
captured the T8L0x family on real hardware in 2026-07 and publishes its model
registry, wire vocabulary and captures. Comparing the two is how the E22's model
code and the protocol split below were confirmed.

##### 12.1 Model registry (`src/model/registry.ts`, `src/model/classify.ts`)

| Code | Product | How this integration treats it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `T8L00` | Permanent Outdoor Light E120 (30 m) | code known, generic path |
| `T8L01` | Permanent Outdoor Light E120 (15 m) | code known, generic path |
| `T8L02` | **Permanent Outdoor Lights E22** | verified model, animation protocol |
| `T8L04` | Permanent Outdoor Lights S4 | code known, generic path |
| `T8L10` | Outdoor String Lights E10 | code known, generic path |
| `T8L20` | Outdoor Spotlights E10 | code known, generic path |
| `T8L30` | Outdoor Pathway Lights E10 | verified end to end here |
| `T8L40` | Indoor Floor Lamp E10 | verified end to end here |

**The E22 is the `T8L02`.** Their classifier routes the whole `/^T8L/` prefix to the
`eufy_life` smart-lighting codec ("its own secure-MQTT DP TLV wire", not the security
stack), so the E22 sits on the same cloud and transport this integration already
speaks — it is not an eufy Security device. Suffixed codes (`T8L02X`, `T8L023E1`)
belong to the same family.

##### 12.2 Family wire facts (all match this integration)

- Outbound MQTT dispatch id `17`, device-to-app envelope cmd `16`; topics
  `cmd/eufy_life/<model>/<sn>/req` and `.../app/res`.
- Commands: `0x0200` get info, `0x0201` set info (`0xA3` power, `0xA4` brightness),
  `0x0204` unsolicited status report, `0x0206` plain colour, `0x0A00` info reply,
  `0x020D` gallery effect.
- State is **reported, not polled**: the light pushes `0x0204` after every change.
  Inbound tags use a different table from the outbound ones (inbound `0xA1` power,
  `0xA2` brightness, `0xA3` segment count, `0xA4` effect id, `0xA6` cloud effect id),
  the same split this integration implements.
- Their effect writer is gated to `T8L02` because "the encoding is per-family and
  reversed for T8L02 only", and it never sends the `0x0200` handshake before an
  effect.

##### 12.3 `0x020D` animation frame — same tag map and blob shape

`dpPresetFields()` (`src/transport/dp-preset.ts`) emits the same frame this
integration builds: `0xA3` cloud id (4B LE), `0xA4` speed (1B), `0xA5` layer count,
`0xA6` execution mode, `0xA8` = `00`, then one `0xA9+i` layer blob per layer. The
layer blob has the same shape too: an 8-10 byte layer header, a type/colour-count
run, one 5-byte RGBCW block per colour, and a type-specific trailer whose length
matches our T8L40 captures exactly (17 bytes for type 0, 10 for type 1, 12 for
type 2).

Two details to keep in mind, both consistent between the projects:

- The layer **execution parameter** is 2 bytes big-endian in our captures and 1 byte
  in theirs (`00 82` either way for the captured value 130, so the captures cannot
  tell the two apart), and one reserved byte holds `01` in our T8L40 captures where
  their serializer writes `00`.
- Field order inside the header/trailer is reversed per model — which is exactly why
  each project gates its effect writer to the model it captured, and why the E22
  here renders the catalog's own `params` JSON instead of the T8L40 blobs.

So the E22 shares the animation path, but **without** the T8L40's handshake and
post-effect silence, which stay T8L40-only traits.

##### 12.4 `0x0206` plain-colour frame — same shape, different filler

`dpColorFields()` (`src/transport/mqtt/dp-color.ts`) produces the layout this
integration captured off the app on real hardware:

| Tag | Captured / sent here | Their verified T8L02 frame |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0xA3` | `20006` (`26 4e`) | `20006` (`26 4e`) |
| `0xA4` | direction (`u16le`) | `00 00` |
| `0xA5` | speed (1…10) | `05` (channel count) |
| `0xA6` | `[block_count]` + that many 5-byte RGBCW blocks | `[1]` + one 5-byte RGBCW block |
| `0xA7` | `[count, indices…]` per colour block | `[count, 0…count-1]` |
| `0xA8` | `64` | `64` |
| `0xA9` / `0xAA` | five zero bytes / `00` | five zero bytes / `00` |
| `0xAB`, `0xAC` | omitted unless a cloud id follows | `00 00`, `ff ff ff ff` |
| `0xB0` | `07` (DIY update method) | `00` |

The `0xA7` positions format (`[count, …]`, one byte per index, 254 segments maximum)
is identical, so a single-colour write is the same frame byte for byte. The `0xA5`
(speed vs channel count), the absent `0xAB`/`0xAC` slots and `0xB0` (`07` vs `00`)
differences are deliberately left alone: both variants come from app captures and
both are accepted by the hardware, and rewriting a captured frame without a device
in front of us is the riskier move.

##### 12.5 Consequences applied here

1. `T8L02` (E22) joined `_KNOWN_MODELS`, so it is no longer an unverified code.
2. The single `modern_protocol` flag became `animation_protocol` (`T8L02` + `T8L40`),
   `session_handshake` and `silent_effect` (`T8L40` only) — only the latter two are
   T8L40 firmware quirks.
3. The captured T8L40 layer blobs are replayed only on the T8L40; every other
   animation-protocol light renders the catalog's own `params` JSON, so the segment
   geometry comes from the model in front of it.
4. Palette capacity is derived, not magic: one TLV value may be 255 bytes and each
   segment costs five, so a frame addresses at most 50 segments.

##### 12.6 Open questions

- No E22 has been driven by this integration yet: it is verified from the sibling
  captures, not from our own hardware. A full-palette `set_light_settings` call and
  the new-format presets are the first things to try.
- Whether the E22 acknowledges an effect with `0x0A0D`, with a `0x0204` report, or
  with both is unknown; the ACK path now accepts either for animation-protocol
  lights.
- Catalog colours are sent as raw `R, G, B, 0, 0`, while the sibling SDK derives
  RGBCW from the T8L02 mixing engine's CIE calibration (exact on pure primaries,
  ~18/255 mean error on mixed colours). That calibration is the next fidelity gain.
